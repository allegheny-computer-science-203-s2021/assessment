### Continuous Integration with Github Actions

* Setup and configuration of GitHub Actions CI
  * None = Does not use Github Actions CI or have it set up on their repository.
  * Inadequate = Set up Github Actions to a workflow that doesn't make sense with the program and its contributors or in a way that isn't functionally committed to the repository.
  * Adequate = Properly set up a Github Actions workflow in a way that is usable to collaborators.
  * Good = Set up a Github Actions workflow that streamlines the workflow process and makes process consistent among devices that have different installations.
  * Excellent = Streamlines all major angles including testing and general communication using Github Actions.

* Performing secure releases of project deliverables
  * None = Does not set up any security features on project deliverables.
  * Inadequate = Sets up some security features on project deliverables, but project information is still easily compromisable.
  * Adequate = Properly sets up all appropriate security features on project deliverables.
  * Good = Properly sets up all appropriate security features on project deliverables in way that is well-suited for given project deliverables.
  * Excellent = Properly sets up all appropriate security features on project deliverables in way that is best-suited for given project deliverables, and actively monitors project for potential security threats or improvements.

* Creating third-party integrations with GitHub Actions CI (e.g., codecov.io)
  * None = Does not create third-party integrations with GitHub Actions CI.  
  * Inadequate = Is able to occasionally integrate GitHub with a third party. Still lacks fundamental knowledge of how to do so consistently
  * Adequate = Contributes third party integrations on a fairly consistent basis. Could use more knowledge on the subject, however.
  * Good = Often times integrates third party software with Github. Very knowledgeable on how to do so.
  * Excellent = Leads the way for the team when integrating Github with a third party. Can easily explain to the team how they did so.

* Adding README badges that show status of GitHub Actions CI builds
  * None = Does not add README badges.
  * Inadequate = Rarely adds README badges that show status of builds, never addressing any errors made.
  * Adequate = Occasionally adds README badges that show status of builds, rarely addressing errors any errors made.
  * Good = Frequently adds README badges that show status of builds, often addressing any errors made.
  * Excellent = Adds README badges that show status of builds, always addressing any errors made.

* Adding README badges that show project characteristics (e.g., coverage and
  language)
  * None = Does not add README badges.
  * Inadequate = Rarely adds README badges that show project characteristics, never addressing any errors made.
  * Adequate = Occasionally adds README badges that show project characteristics, rarely addressing errors any errors made.
  * Good = Frequently adds README badges that show that show project characteristics, often addressing any errors made.
  * Excellent = Adds README badges that show project characteristics, always addressing any errors made.

* Identifying and resolving problems with failing builds in GitHub Actions CI
  * None = Ignores all problems in GitHub Actions CI, routinely makes and does not resolve basic coding errors.
  * Inadequate = Occasionally identifies problems with builds, does not solve problems.
  * Adequate = Frequently identifies problems, occasionally solves them partially.
  * Good = Frequently identifies problems and makes strides to solve them at least partially. Occasionally provides documentation.
  * Excellent = Routinely identifies and solves the problems behind failing builds and documents any fixes for future use.
