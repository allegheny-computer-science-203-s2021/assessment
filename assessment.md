### Foundations of Software Engineering

* Requirements engineering

* :flushed: = Fails to adds any requirements for the program and shows no knowledge of what the program is doing
* :worried: = Adding requirements, but not making them user-focused.
* :neutral_face: = Adding user-focused requirements, but not having appropriate estimates for those requirements.
* :blush: = Adding user-focused requirements with appropriate estimates, but the individual requirements involve a multitude of different tasks instead of just one.
* :laughing: = Adding user-focused requirements with appropriate estimates, and the individual requirments involve only one task.

* Software architecture

* :flushed: = The program demonstrates no understanding or implementation of software architecture.
* :worried: = The program displays experience with software architecture, but there are flow and design issues.
* :neutral_face: = The program displays experience and understanding of software architecture with minimal flow and design issues.
* :blush: = the program displays an extensive knowledge of software architecture theory and underlying experience with no flow or design issues.
* :laughing: = the program displays an extensive knowledge of software theory and underlying experience as a means of conducting and managing the design/flow. The student develops concepts and is able to help other team members with the architecture of their software.

* Software design

* :flushed: = Doesn't even attempt to solve the problem.
* :worried: = Creates incorrect software to solve the problem.
* :neutral_face: = Creates correct software to solve the problem.
* :blush: = Creates correct and efficient software to solve the problem.
* :laughing: = Creates correct and efficient software while constantly thinking of how to make it more efficient.

* Software documentation

* :flushed: = No explanation of what the software does, no solution to the problem presented, and no example of where the code be used is included
* :worried: = A short explanation, no solution to the problem, and no example is included
* :neutral_face: = A good explanation, a short solution to the problem, and a short example is included
* :blush: = A detailed explanation, a solution to the problem, a short example is included
* :laughing: = A detailed explanation, a detailed solution to the problem, a interactive example is included

* Programming styles

* :flushed: = Does not have the ability to program at all in any style.
* :worried: = Programming style is completely akin to "spaghetti code."
* :neutral_face: = Programming style is slightly akin to "spaghetti code." with some correct naming conventions, indentations, and little or non-descriptive commenting.
* :blush: = Programming style is fairly thorough and mostly uses proper naming conventions, indentations, and a fair amount of commenting. Styling is mostly consistent at this level.
* :laughing: = Programming style is very thorough and uses proper naming conventions, indentations, and is descriptively commented throughout. Styling is consistent at this level.

* Managing software complexity

* :flushed: = Written software is at a state where once the author has left the code, it is quite possible they would not be able to recognize what they left behind. Complexities reach a level so high that code becomes illegible to any reader.
* :worried: = Written software is not efficient in nature and often strays into unnecessary complexities; conditional statements are frequently overly convoluted and hard-coding is consistently present throughout.
* :neutral_face: = Written software is hardly efficient in nature and occasionally strays into unnecessary complexities; conditional statements can occasionally be overly convoluted and hard-coding is frequently present.
* :blush: = Written software is decently efficient in nature and barely strays into unnecessary complexities; conditional statements are often not overly convoluted and hard-coding is only semi-present at best.
* :laughing: = Written software is incredibly efficient in nature and does not stray into unnecessary complexities or perhaps enter complexity without reason; conditional statements are not overly convoluted and hard-coding is hardly, if at all present.

* Mitigating software risk

* :flushed: = Does not attempt to mitigate or identify potential risks. Does not make an effort to communicate with teammates or handle problems.
* :worried: = Makes little attempt to mitigate or identify risks. Low effort in communication and planning.
* :neutral_face: = Makes an attempt to mitigate and identify risks. Communicates with teammates about some risks but may not be adequately prepared.
* Good = Makes a good attempt at identifying and mitigating potential risks. Takes some early action to prevent problems. Often communicates with teammates about potential issues. Is often able to handle unexpected problems.  
* :laughing: = Identifies potential risks and actively works to avoid them. Communicates with group members to effectively prevent and manage any risks or problems. Is able to handle unexpected problems when they do appear and asks for help when appropriate.

* Software testing

* :flushed: = Does not have the tools installed to run the software in the first place.
* :worried: = Has the correct tools installed but does not run the software or test cases.
* :neutral_face: = Has the correct tools installed and runs the software, but doesn't run the test cases.
* :blush: = Has the correct tools installed, runs the software, and runs the test cases.
* :laughing: = identifies and understands which tools to use to test the software while
    also providing documentation and advice that helps other team members develop
    this skill.

* Software refactoring

* :flushed: = Does not utilize appropriate refactoring at all, code may be unreadable or messy.
* :worried: = Begins to utilize refactoring but it does not lead to improvements in the readability or performance of the code, or the refactoring changes the functionality of the code inappropriately. Refactoring may have introduced new bugs and problems that remain unsolved.
* :neutral_face: = Sometimes utilizes refactoring when necessary, making the code cleaner. Refactoring does not fix performance issues. Code may still be messy but is not unreadable. Refactoring does not change functionality of code.
* :blush: = Often uses refactoring when necessary. Code is readable. Refactoring fixes some code performance issues. The functionality of the code does not change.
* :laughing: = Always uses refactoring when necessary. Code is clean and easily readable. Refactoring is used to eliminate any bugs, simplify code, and improve software performance. There is no change to functionality.
