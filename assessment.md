## Technical Skills

### Software Development with Python

* Configuring a development environment for Python

  * 😳 = Development environment not configured.
  * 😟 = Development environment only partially configured.
  * 😐 = Development environment fully configured, but not tested.
  * 😊 = Development environment fully configured and operational.
  * 😆 = Development environment fully configured and operational, with access to all other tools needed in the course to complete assignments and projects with python.

* Running Python programs with `pyenv` and `pipenv`

  * 😳 = `pyenv` and `pipenv` are not installed on the machine
  * 😟 = `pyenv` and `pipenv` are installed but not setup
  * 😐 = `pyenv` and `pipenv` are installed and setup
  * 😊 = `pyenv` and `pipenv` are installed and setup and used to run program
  * 😆 = `pyenv` and `pipenv` are installed and setup to run program and test suite with `pytest: pipenv run pytest`

* Linting Python programs with `pylint` and `flake8`

  * 😳 = `pylint` and `flake8` are not installed on machine
  * 😟 = `pylint` and `flake8` are installed but not setup for use on machine
  * 😐 = `pylint` and `flake8` are setup and able to be used on code in text editor
  * 😊 = Able to run and use `pylint` and `flake8` in text editor to see mistakes or suggestions
  * 😆 = Able to run and use `pylint` and `flake8` in text editor to see suggestions by the programs and correct these mistakes while understanding why these instances needed to be changed to follow proper formatting

* Formatting Python programs with `black`

  * 😳 = `black` formatting is not installed on machine
  * 😟 = `black` formatting is installed but not used
  * 😐 = `black` formatting is installed and used, but there are more than 2 formatting errors
  * 😊 = `black` formatting is installed and used, but there are 1-2 formatting errors
  * 😆 = `black` formatting is correctly used with no formatting errors

* Basic testing of Python programs with `pytest`

  * 😳 = Does not use `pytest`
  * 😟 = Uses `pytest`, but every test fails, or only uses a couple of basic tests.
  * 😐 = Uses `pytest`, and includes some test cases and a few tests pass, or a few test
  * 😊 = Uses `pytest`, and either includes a sufficient amount of test cases, but not all pass, or includes almost enough test cases to cover all parts and every test passes.
  * 😆 = Uses `pytest`, and includes enough test cases to cover every aspect of the program, and all tests pass.
