 *Adequate = Uses docstrings that contain basic documentation that allow for a better understanding of the program.

 *Good = Uses docstrings that contain a high-level overview of the program and allow for a good understanding of the program flow.

 *Excellent = Uses docstrings that allow for readers to gain a high-level understanding of program flow and allows for further work to be done on code without any previous knowledge of the project itself.

programmer is doing through the whole program

programmer is doing for a small portion of the program

programmer is doing for some of the program

 *Good = Uses clear and concise naming conventions to convey what the
programmer is doing for most of the program

 *Excellent  Utilizes clear and concise naming conventions to convey
what the programmer is doing throughout the whole program

* Using exception handling to create a robust Python program

 *None = Does not use exception handling in Python

 *Inadequate = Using "try" and "except" for Exception Handling partially for the program.

 *Adequate = Using "try" and "except" for Exception Handling concisely and when required.

 *Good = Using "raise" to throw an exception for different conditions and the concise usage of
 "try" and "except" for Exception Handling in most parts of the program.

 *Excellent = Using "raise" to throw an exception for different conditions and the concise usage of
 "try" and "except" for Exception Handling throughout the whole program when required.

* Refactoring a Python program to improve its characteristics

 *None = Code is not refactored and remains in it's original state.

 *Inadequate = Code is refactored with minimal changes to the structure/flow of the program.

 *Adequate = Code reflects a noticeable restructure and maintains all of it's previous function

 *Good = Code reflects a beneficial restructure in terms of efficiency and performs all operations as previously expected.

 *Excellent = Code is majorly restructured with large efficiency improvements over the previous program.

* Debugging Python programs using logging and other methods

 *None =

 *Inadequate =

 *Adequate =

 *Good =

 *Adequate = Able to apply Python language on a somewhat consistent basis and have a generally understanding on the fundamentals.

 *Good = Able to utilize the language to a fairly proficient degree and have a good grasp on the fundamentals.

 *Excellent = Clear and concise use of Python language, knowing what the use for the right situations.

* Adopting and using appropriate Python packages

 *None = Uses inappropriate Python packages making code unclear

 *Inadequate = Uses very few appropriate Python packages, code still unclear

 *Adequate = Uses some appropriate Python packages

 *Good = Uses most of the needed Python packages clearly making code almost fully clear

 *Excellent = Uses all of the needed Python packages clearly

* Adhering to industry best practices for programming in Python

 *None = Does not make an attempt to adhere to industry best practices.

 *Inadequate = Attempts to adhere to industry best practices but does not meet the satisfactions.
