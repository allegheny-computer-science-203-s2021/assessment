* Software refactoring

* :flushed: = Does not utilize appropriate refactoring at all, code may be unreadable or messy.
* :worried: = Begins to utilize refactoring but it does not lead to improvements in the readability or performance of the code, or the refactoring changes the functionality of the code inappropriately. Refactoring may have introduced new bugs and problems that remain unsolved.
* :neutral_face: = Sometimes utilizes refactoring when necessary, making the code cleaner. Refactoring does not fix performance issues. Code may still be messy but is not unreadable. Refactoring does not change functionality of code.
